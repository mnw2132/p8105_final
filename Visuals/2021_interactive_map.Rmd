This document for visualizing the cleaned/tidied data set.The beginning of this code is a repeat of the tidied data from Data Preparation. This was performed again since there was an issue in the geometry  of the final_data.csv. So we will be working with a data set called tick_lyme_weather with proper geometry attributes needed to make maps.
